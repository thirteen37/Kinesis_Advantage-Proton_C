# QMK-compatible replacement board for Kinesis Advantage

This replacement board allows you to use QMK on the [Kinesis Advantage
(KB500USB)](https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/advantage/).

This is the original version of the Kinesis Advantage and it lacks
much of the nice programmability and advanced features of the newer
[Advantage 2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/advantage2/) keyboards.

The replacement controller board here uses a [QMK Proton
C](https://qmk.fm/proton-c/). The replacement maintains the use of all
keys, all LEDs, and even the speaker for audio. You will also get to
replace the USB connector for a USB-C one. The only downside is that
the USB ports and optional foot pedals will not work here.
